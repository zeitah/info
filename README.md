# info
A blacklist for media that has explicit or implicit LGBTQ+ prejudice or racism  
`ratings.txt` contains safety ratings by type  
`meta.txt`    contains information about rating possibly with spoilers  
  
## Informational Aside
I do not support the idea that participants in creation of any media should be blacklisted.  
They don't necessarily even have the full script for the work they do.  
Nor do I believe that original authors should be judged for recreation details.
