0 The White Lotus   
Actors play gay roles in which they are having sex with women,
as if their sexuality was entirely performative. 
Same actors all turn out to be homicidal.
Actress expresses distaste that she encountered non-binary individuals too often while dating.

The Mighty Boosh
This show is great, but it's difficult to watch now
One of the characters they create speaks of their mangina and is a generally repulsive lake monster.

Harry Potter
Author became a avid transphobe and preaches and writes gender critical violence.

Lovecraft Country    T[F]=9_VE     G=7_I
A transwoman(possibly two spirit) is murdered directly after introduction violently by a gay man.
I stopped watching the show, may have redeemed itself somehow

Bob's Burgers        T[F] (see meta.txt)
The show has unatractive women representing transgendered-women.
I think that the opinion is a pretty privilege invocation.
They are Bob's friend and he genders them correctly throughout.
In my opinion we could use more representation in a don't look like a pornstar category.
